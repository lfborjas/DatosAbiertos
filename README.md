## Setup

Instead of checking an .rvmvc file and causing pain to people, we trust
that you, the developer, will have a sensible way of sandboxing your
gems. The ruby version in use for development is 1.9.3

### Installing gems

To install all gems needed for development/testing:

    bundle install

### Setting up the relational database

You need to provide your own copy of database.yml in
`config/database.yml`, you can use the `config/database.yml.example` as
reference. Once that's in place, run

    rake db:setup

To create databases, run migrations and set up the test database. 

Whenever you generate a new migration (directly or via `rails g model`),
don't forget to run

  rake db:migrate && rake db:test:prepare

To apply the migrations and update the test schema, respectively. 

### Running tests

To run both cucumber features and rspecs:
  
  rake

To run only cucumber features:

  rake cucumber

To run only specs

  rake spec
